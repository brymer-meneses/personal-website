title: Coping with Regrets

I made lots of regrets throughout my 19 years of existence, some negligible but there are some that still haunt
me to this day. I still blame myself for those moments, I just can't stop telling myself that,

"_Had I been smarter this would have never happened--I could have significantly altered my future._"

When I was in Grade 6, I was fortunate enough to become a valedictorian, that means I get the privilege
to give a speech in front of an audience during my graduation. Both my parents, and grandparents were eager to hear what I would say.

As I came up to the lectern, I became nervous. But I successfully managed to recite it in an eloquent manner, nope
just kidding, I just read the whole script in a fast-paced manner, like a rapper in a broken disk because my nerves got the best of me.

I still think of the fact that I never really thanked my grandmother, about the sacrifices she made to me. I remember thinking that I would
do my best in high-school to become a valedictorian and hopefully do it again, but it turns out that I wasn't smart enough to achieve that, she also didn't live long enough for that.

My Grandmother, Agripina Rous, came all the way from abroad to take care of me, she did a lot of things and I never really thanked her appropriately, I could have, but I never did.

There are many examples of this, throughout my life, the most recent being not having the courage to transfer to UP Diliman. I grew up in province for the vast majority of my life, and the prospect of living in Manila scared me, to the point that I never got the 'push' I needed to submit my application.

It is now just sinking in how much opportunity I have squandered. But it is what is is, I guess, I can only use the pain right now to motivate my
self in pursuing my ambitions. I want to become a world-class researcher in the field of machine learning, and I will do everything I can to make
sure that happens, even if I think that's highlight unlikely.

To be honest, I'm quite frightened imagining my future self laying on its death bed, would I be happy of the decisions I am making right now?
Would I regret not courting this girl I have feelings for ever since 9th grade? I don't know, I wish I knew the parameters that would lead me to the path of "least regret," but I don't know.

I'll just have to learn from them, and divert that debilitating pain to something productive.
